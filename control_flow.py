# Control Flow
# if, else if/elif, else
# Conditional statements are used to control the flow of our program

age = 14
# if the user is above the age of 15 allow them to buy a ticket
if age >= 15: # If this condition is met/true the print statement will execute
    print("Thank you, please proceed to your purchase.")

# if the user is under 15 years of age do not allow to buy a ticket
elif age < 15:
    print("Sorry you are under age to watch this movie.")

# else block gets executed if non of the above conditions met
else:
    print("Oops something went wrong, please try later.")

# Exercise -
# As a user I would like to sell tickets according to the age of the user
# and category of the movie
# age = 12a, PG, U, 15 and 18
# user input to let us know the age to decide whether to sell the ticket or not
# casting implemented
# display the age back to the user with appropiate message
